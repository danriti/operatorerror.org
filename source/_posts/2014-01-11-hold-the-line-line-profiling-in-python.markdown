I wrote an article on the [Appneta Blog][1] where I discussed line profiling
in [Python][2]:

> If you've ever profiled code in Python, you've probably used the
**cProfile** module. While the **cProfile** module is quite powerful, I find it
involves a lot of boilerplate code to get it setup and configured before
you can get useful information out of it. Being a fan of the KISS
principle, I want an easy and unobtrusive way to profile my code. Thus, I find
myself using the **line_profiler** module due to it's simplicity and superior
output format.

I'm a big fan of tools that are simple to use, yet powerful in nature. Being
both efficient and productive are important qualities in my daily workflow, so
check out the [article][1] to learn more!
