I wrote an article on the [Appneta Blog][1] where I discussed automating your
[PyPI][2] deployment with [Travis CI][3]:

> As the sole maintainer of the python-traceview library, I’ve been following a
simple deploy process I cooked up for getting new releases of the library on
PyPI (the Python Package Index). Now that I’ve been maintaining the project for
almost 2 years, the “excitement” of doing a manual release has come and gone.
So naturally I began to ask myself: How can I automate releasing to PyPI?

If you've ever dreaded merging a pull request simply because you don't want to
go through the hassle of doing a manual release, then you should check out
the [article][1] to learn how to automate your release.
