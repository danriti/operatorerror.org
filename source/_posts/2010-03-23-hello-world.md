Welcome to Operator Error!

I learn a lot of random things everyday between my job and my personal interests. I figured a blog would be a good place for me to capture these learnings and then in turn, share them with the world.

That being said, I have no actual focus for what topics this blog will cover. I figure I can decide if something is **blog worthy** when I learn about it.

Enjoy~
