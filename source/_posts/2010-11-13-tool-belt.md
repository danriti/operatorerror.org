Batman relied heavy on his tool belt whenever he was in a pinch. So should you! Below is a list of some tools that I&#8217;ve found very useful when working on projects:

*   [toggl][1] &#8211; Time tracking that works. Free and paid options available.
*   [Bitnami][2] &#8211; Wide array of development stacks (think LAMP/WAMP) that are a cinch to deploy and allow you to get to work quickly.
*   [Smuxi][3] &#8211; Irssi inspired, open source, GNOME-based, cross platform IRC client. Loving it.
*   [Geany][4] &#8211; Linux text editor that is GTK2 based and offers basic features of an integrated development environment. Lightweight, tons of features, and clean.
*   [Rublar][5] &#8211; a Ruby regular expression editor. Great for building and testing regular expressions.

Enjoy!
