I wrote an article on the [Appneta Blog][1] about my new open source project
called [Burndown][2].

> Although there are many unique characteristics for each software development methodology, one thing is consistent: the goal of **progress**. Everyone wants to know how a particular project or task is coming along and when it’s going to be complete. So even if you don’t believe in due dates and delivering to a schedule, it’s still useful to know and to be able to communicate your current progress to others .

> To aid us on our never-ending quest to know just how awesome we really are, we’ve developed [Burndown][2], an open source tool to assist in tracking progress of a Github milestone!
