I wrote an article on the [Appneta Blog][1] about some of the new features that
have recently been added to [Burndown][2]! Some of the new features include:

- 30 day summary view of a Github repository
- Filter Github milestone issues by label
- Several milestone view enhancements

For more details, head on over and [check it out][1].
