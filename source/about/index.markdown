Hi, I’m Dan.

I’m a computer engineer forging a path in the world of software development.

By day, I currently work for <a href="https://appneta.com">Appneta</a> where I
help keep the web <a href="http://www.appneta.com/products/traceview/">fast</a>.
In the past, I've also worked on real-time control systems for a major
Department of Defense contractor.

By night, I like to explore the open source world and its associated
technologies. My interests include, but not limited to Python, Javascript,
social APIs and Git.

My hobbies include rollerblading, DJing, collecting music and reading (fantasy,
technology, blogs).
